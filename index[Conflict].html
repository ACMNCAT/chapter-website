				<h2>Our Chapter</h2>
				<p>Here at <a href="http://www.ncat.edu" target = "_blank">NC A & T</a>, our number one goal is to ensure
					that all of our members are well equipped for the workforce upon receiving their
					respective degrees. We do so by hosting weekly meetings, tutoring sessions, and
					countless chapter events such as hack-a-thons and interview workshops. From developing
					fully responsive websites to creating the next big startup company, there is
					truly never a dull moment in this chapter.
					<br/><br/>
					If you are interested in joining, we meet every Wednesday at 7:00 PM in McNair Hall. For more
					information, <q><a id="jump" href="#contact">contact us</a></q> today!

				<h2>Special Interest Groups</h2>
				<p>ACM’s Special Interest Groups (SIGs) represent the major areas of the dynamic computing field.
					A primary source of original research and personal perspectives from the world's leading
					thinkers in computing and information technology, they foster technical communities within
					their respective specialties across countries and continents.
					<br/><br/>
					ACM’s SIGs are invested in advancing the skills of their members, keeping them abreast of
					emerging trends. They offer opportunities for networking with colleagues, staying connected
					to peers and negotiating the strategic challenges of the digital age.
					<br/><br/>
					This year, we want to see what SIGs interest our members most. Check out the
					<a href="http://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/sigs-by-knowledge-area" target = "_blank">full list</a>
					of SIGs to see where you may fit in then <a href="mailto:acmncat@gmail.com">email</a> us to
